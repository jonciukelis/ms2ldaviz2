# Requirements

to run an LDA experiment

to include relevant motifdb sets if there (i.e., select the relevant motif sets based on sample, polarity, etc.)

to explore which experiment options (probability and overlap threshold) I can use best for the experiment by looking at how the motifs and their degrees change upon changing the thresholds, and by looking at individual motifs and how their feature frequency plots

to explore motifdb matched motifs by looking at their degrees and how the fragmentation patterns found by MS2LDA compare to those stored in motifdb (if they differ a lot, I shouldnâ€™t trust the annotation)

to explore yet unknown motifs (very important feature) by looking at feature frequency plots, mass spectra of connected molecules with fragmentation patterns indicated. This information helps to annotate the motif.

to explore MAGMa annotations of fragment peaks and neutral losses to assist in structural annotation of motifs

to annotate yet unknown motifs and store their annotations

to share experiments publicly and use MS2LDA to report the experimental details

to import LDA models run locally or on GNPS (to explore the Mass2Motifs in more detail, i.e. check annotations or make new annotations - see also points above)

to submit an annotated motif set to motifdb

to explore the network visualisation plot to see how motifs are connected in the data set through their connected molecules (finding related motifs)

to explore public experiments published supporting motif annotations

to explore motifdb annotated motif sets

to import gensim LDA models run locally and then share them publicly (in the nearby future?? - it is currently possible to upload a gensim lda model, but size-wise it is not affordable on the web app)
